        This How To Guide covers the HTML5 library and creates new documentation related to implementing the download attribute. This is a relatively new feature that can be used a few different ways, however it is not currently available for all browser types using HTML5. This How To Guide will also cover that issue, and suggest a fix for that using PHP. In addition, there is another download behavior discussed that uses JavaScript. The reason for the extra documentation, is simply because HTML falls short when trying to implement file downloads for the user.

        People interact and consume website data faster and in larger volumes today. They also download, modify, and upload that data more often. The code reviewed is not complicated to understand, however I chose to cover this topic purely based off of the lack of information available on the web covering this feature, more importantly, how to expand on it. While starting my final project, I wanted to create a way for users to download their data, and found the documentation of this feature to be lacking outside of forum posts.
